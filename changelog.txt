``Browser.session.headers`` dict
* Since ``headers`` keyword argument isn't called anymore, you can add specific headers for a single request

all informations
* User can define history object base on the `BaseHistory` class
* Improve tests for new history

Backward compatibility breaks :

* the private property ``_headers`` no longer exists
* the ``back`` parameter for the ``open_url`` method has been removed
